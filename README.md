<h1>My First Public Website</h1>
<p>This is a my first public website, I am very excited to make it better in the future. I am currently planning to improve it to the point that I will 
actually use it as my personal archieve of stuff (of course I will have a hard copy of all the code for fullproofing purposes). But other than that I am
just enjoying my journey to web development. I hope that this website will stay function and be contantly updated and not forgotten in the corner like some
of my other projects. Well, thanks for reading, I hope you have a wonderful day.</p>
